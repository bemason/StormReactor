        ## Overview 
        
        This library has been developed in an effort to systematize quantitative analysis of stormwater control algorithms. It is a natural extension of the Open-Storm's mission to open up and ease access into the technical world of smart stormwater systems. We have now developed a toolbox so that anyone can model any stormwater pollutant treatment method in any node or link. One can implement any SWMM treatment or any user-defined treatment.   
        
        
        ## Getting Started 
        
        ### Installation 
        
        **Requirements**
        
        - python 3+
        - numpy
        - pyswmm
        - scipy
        
        
        ```bash 
        pip install StormReactor
        ```
        
        Please raise an issue on the repository or reach out if you run into any issues installing the package. 
        
        ### Example 
        
        Here is an example implementation on how you would use this library for evaluating the ability of a rule based control in maintaining the flows in a network below a desired threshold. 
        
        ```python 
        import StormReactor
        from pyswmm import Simulations,Nodes
        
        # Enter example here
        
        ```
